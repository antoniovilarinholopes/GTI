4.3.a)
declare default element namespace "http://www.parlamento.pt";

for $politician in //politician
let $num-interventions:=count(for $speech in //speech
			where $speech[@politician = $politician/@code]
			return $speech)
return
	insert node (attribute num-interventions {$num-interventions})
	into //politician[@code=$politician/@code]

b) E melhor rever com mais exemplos mais tarde

for $politician in //politician
let $num-sessions := count(for $session in //session
		where $session[speech/@politician=$politician/@code]
		return $session)
return
	insert node (attribute num-sessions {$num-sessions})
	into $politician

c) Posso usar o distinct-values?

for $session in //session
let $party-frequency := (
		for $party in distinct-values(//politician/@party)
		let $frequency := count(
			for $speech in $session/speech
			where $speech[@politician=//politician[@party=$party]/@code]
			return $speech
			)
		order by $frequency descending
		return (<party-interventions name="{$party}" session="{$session/@date}">{$frequency}</party-interventions>))
return 
	insert node (attribute most-frequent {$party-frequency[1]/@name})
	into $session
